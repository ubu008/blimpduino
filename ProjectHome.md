Blimpduino is a very low cost open source autonomous blimp. It consists of an Arduino-based blimp controller board with on-board infrared and ultrasonic sensors and an interface for an optional RC mode, a simple gondola with two vectoring (tilting) differential thrusters, and ground-based infrared beacon.

It is available as a commercial kit ($89) from the [Maker Shed](http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=mkca1) or the [DIY Drones store](http://store.diydrones.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=5).

This is the repository for the board's code, which can be found in the download section at right. It requires the free [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to edit and upload the code to the Blimpduino board.
